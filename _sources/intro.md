Welcome to an interactive Jupyter Book for the Web Based Systems-[*WBS*](https://finki.ukim.mk/mk/subject/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B1-%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B8) at Ss. Cyril and Methodius University â€“ Skopje-[*UKIM*](http://www.ukim.edu.mk/), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering-[*FCSE*](https://www.finki.ukim.mk/).  

This Jupyter Book lets you interact with a code. You can change the code by inline on the pages or launch a MyBinder session to run your code in a Jupyter Notebook in another tab. The figures are made interactive using [Plotly](https://plotly.com).
